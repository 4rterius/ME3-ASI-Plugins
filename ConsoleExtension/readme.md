The Console extension ASI adds new console commands to Mass Effect 3

Commands added by this ASI:
* `savecam`: saves the position of the camera while in flycam mode to one of ten slots. Must be followed by a digit, 0-9. Example usage: `savecam 0`
* `loadcam`: same as `savecam`, but sets the camera to a saved position. Must be used while in flycam.
